regarding fan translations,hey everyone a short hike now has multilingual support there are currently official french spanish japanese and brazilian portuguese translations of the game i'm not planning to add additional official translations at the moment making fan translations a number of fan translations have already been made for a short hike i think this is really cool and i'm so happy that people took the time to translate the script which isn't short to new languages since version 17 you can now easily modify the dialogue files for the game without modding it however just keep in mind that fan translations will not be officially added to the game once they are completed if you're working on a fan translation please consider sharing it on the   this makes it easier for people to find and collaborate on translations editing game dialogue in the ashorthikedata folder you can find a file called langcustomyarnlinescsv this contains all the dialogue in the game in the csv format if you rename it to remove the first underscore it will appear in the languages menu ingame allowing you to load it to give your translation a name you can rename it to langmylanguageyarnlinescsv and it will still show up as mylanguage in the menu i recommend editing the spreadsheet in google sheets since it will always preserve the correct csv delimiters other character sets to force the game to use different character sets you can add a font row to the csv only three other character sets are supported right now linecode  linetext font  chinese1201001 font  korean162 font  japanese122 font  cyrillic16 feel free to reach out to me via  discordgg  or  adamgryucom  for support installing fan translations after downloading a file called langmylanguageyarnlinescsv drag it into the ashorthikedata folder wherever the game is installed then just relaunch the game and the translation should appear in the language settings here are some finished fan translations i've found so far  note that i was not involved in their creation in any way and cannot vouch for their quality german korean russian czech turkish by berfuji italian chinese stay safe out there  adam
faq  can i adjust amount of pixelation,i designed the game with the pixelated look in mind and i like it however i get that it's not everyone's cup of tea if you want to adjust the pixelation options > graphics > pixel size this will allow you to decrease the effect or remove it entirely hope this helps
discord server,pleeease set up an official discord server

missing achievements,went through and finished the game and nearly all achievos if not all of them and steam just didn't want to recognize it completely had to restart steam and then when i went to sleep in game it gave the ending achievement but i already collected all 22 feathers gold and silver watered nearly every plant if not all etc etc i really don't like replaying through games any suggestions here
5 years later and this game is still amazing,this game lived on my backlog for so long and i regret it finished it and reviewed it   are there any games with similar vibes

help my save file doesn't load,i have been playing the game on gamepass and then bought it on steam i was progressing well in my game until one day my pc suddenly shut off now the game doesn't want to start my game but it does let me create new ones and navigate the menu does my save file have any salvation or should i resign myself to starting the game from scratch again
other games with similar control gameplay style,i really loved controlling claire and exploring around with her so i was wondering if there were other games with the same or pretty similar control gameplay style
how do i exit the binoculars w  keyboard and mouse,got stuck  looking through the binoculars
xbox controller issues,i use a xbox one bt controller and 1 it is detected as a trash chars string in the advanced controller option  instead of something like xbox controller or anything else 2 the game uses annoying press b0 b1 b2 b3 instead of correct abxy is there a workaround fix for this gamepad does work at least but device name and buttons are incorrectly displayed
xbox controller  pressing b randomly opens menu,this is actually for the gog version of the game but i'm posting here for extra visibility i'm having an issue with my xbox wireless controller on win 10 where pressing b will sometimes open the menu the same as pressing y this is incredibly annoying and it means that i can't fish since it opens the menu sometimes instead of reeling in the fish i'm using the official wireless adapter for windows i've tested the controls via the menu and in the test screen they appear to be detected fine it's just that when playing the game it acts as though b is interpreted as y about half the time has anyone come across this before it's a shame since i'm enjoying playing the game otherwise but this is frustrating
max amount of coins,your total amount of coins at the end after buying everything and finding all the coins should be 1291 you can remove 25 coins from that if you bought the sunhat at higher price you can remove 60 120 or 180 if you didn't give 400 coins to the though boy as soon as possible you can add 7 14 or 21 if you take off the coins from the medals i used this map  to find all the coins there are 4 coins with the slides off description these coins will slides off into oblivion after loading the game you need to be near them when loading to get them

map,is there a map from the whole isle
achievements not unlocking,i didn't find any fixes here for my problem any help
why did you buy this game,i'm currently a bit confused i received this game for free on egs as anyone who is a rational gamer would have are people purchasing this game on steam if so why it was offered for free to keep permanently on the egs
trading cards,it'd be pretty cool if this game had a trading card system i reckon badges for this game would be adorable
a stormy view bug,i found the   crumbling blue house near the cemetery   and thought it looked like somewhere that treasure might be hidden i got the treasure before getting the treasure map that led to it and now whenever i read the a stormy view treasure map it doesn't say i think i've already got this one afterwards
horrible controls,i need to get a rant or a scream off my chest here this is a lovely game but it does not help at all i can barely control the little monster of a character let alone pan the camera around to see where i am going especially in regards to trying to fly to golden leaf this is the opposite of what a game is supposed to do instead of fun i've driven myself to motion sickness and being really upset with the game itself forget accessible to those with difficulties it's barely accessible to those of us without them
how much reading is in this game,i bought the lil' gator game for my 5 year old daughter and she likes playing it a lot but i have to read everything to her and there is a lot more to read than i thought there would be so i was wondering how much reading is in this game is there a lot a little is reading needed to have fun  i've done a lot of reading for my girl on the gator game and wasn't wanting to do tons of reading on another

remember this day forever,does anyone have any tips on getting the achievement 'remember this day forever' i'm finding it a bit difficult with a keyboardmy best score has been 20 hits
my thoughts and questions after reaching the top,i've just played and finished this game it was for free on epic game store first the camera is just awful it is by far the biggest reason for me to stop playing after i reached the top after about 1h15m second having no map is a real annoyance for an otherwise extremely pleasant game the compass is pretty useless for me 1 is there a mod which adds a map 2 because i play on egs i don't think there are any achievements right 3 is there a way to turn the camera manually
the last feather bug,hey everyone i'm trying to get all the golden feathers but it looks like i'm blocked at 19 and i don't know why i've looked on internet for all the feathers locations and i just can't find the last one that is missing i don't know wich one btw is this a bug or could someone help me on this please
a few questions,1 is there any promotional content ie anything only available for a limited time or more complicated than just buying dlc 2 is there anything permanently missable even rewards for fulfilling specific conditions 3 is this game identical on all platforms including the switch version having an ingame achievement system 4 are there any bonuses for having save data from a different video game
new features,for a small game that costs 10 dollars and a game that is worth like 2 hours of playtime to complete i think we have what is kind of a complete version of the game however they should add some more secrets achievements or maybe some more open world stuff like cars planes vehicles more characters and more side quests
trading cards,for a game that is very simple relaxing and enjoyable don't you think they should add trading cards first of all you can just make the trading cards just on the certain characters claire bumps into like the rock climbers the dude who lost his watch the guy who sells overpriced feathers and so on second it would be awesome if we can get a badge that shows our appreciation to the game
a short  hike 2,is this be something the devs would consider would be nice to see more fun mini games added like karting and perhaps cave exploration or underwater stuff thanks
saves,how do the saves work  is it manual saves or auto saves at checkpoints or some other method
shouldn't be steam deck verified,title screen says press a and nothing happens at all no bluetooth controller or anything just straight up trying to play on the steam deck does not work
a short hike not loading on my mac,i can open the game from steam but after the initial animation in a circle and the 'humble' logo it's just a blank screen with the spinning beach ball of doom  i end up needing to force quit since the game is not responding and fails to load i have not been able to play the game at all since buying it and am struggling to figure out if there's anything i can do
mac + xbox controller not working,played the game on my windows 10 pc with an xbox controller and it all works properly installed on my mac today so i could play away from the desk but the xbox controller just acts crazy when i press buttons on the main menu abxy do nothing the dpad just makes the menu spaz out right goes down sometimes then left then right then down etc something else launches a steam screen record feature and that's all i can do i can't even go back or make any selections the same controller works perfectly with other games like vampire survivors towerfall big picture mode etc but not this game for some reason tried a beta version as well but that didn't fix the issue it also takes like 23 minutes to get to the main menu from a black screen on mac main menu also says press z to start with controller connected any advice for getting my controller to work though i see this has been an ongoing issue in some old threads edit added additional info
is the music for you on while ciimbing to hawk peak scractchy,i've never had issues with my speakers but it's possible they could be being peaked by the high pitch sounds i suspect the file is too compressed but i haven't ruled out every possibility i had hoped the files would be in a standard format so i could replace them with the bandcamp version but alas they are not
thank you devs,playing a short hike felt like getting a compliment from someone or getting an unexpected gift from a relative i genuinely did not expect a steam game to make me feel so good with no ulterior motives like getting me to purchase lootboxes or whatever it's just genuine positive fun  you guys made the world a bit better thank you
achievements not working in steam,i had this game by gog and finished it now i bought it on steam and wanted to play it again to get the achievements here but even starting again all the achievements are already unlocked inside the game but not in steam how can i unlock it or at least make a complete reset in the game registry so i can do it again please thanks
actually rainbow trout,it's my last fish in the fishing journal which i fish in the deep water for like an hour but still couldn't get any is there any location to make it fish easier
ps4 controller registers as xbox 360 controller,just started playing and for some reason the game registers my dualshock ps4 controller as an xbox 360 one meaning all the button icons are wrong not gamebreaking just annoying also the camera controls are inverted which isnt the biggest deal for this game specifically but there doesnt seem to be a way to invert them any advice on how to fix these issues thank you in advance
how similar,i've been playing a lot of haven park recently with my daughter  i recently came across this game of which looks very similar
mod setting to remove the brown out on distant features,love the game to bits but always find it a bit of a shame the game browns out distant features any time you have a long sightline such as when flying or using a stationary telescope is there any existing mod method of removing this could be this causes single digit fps
postcompletion activities,i have a suggestion i think would be fun to have  easter egg style hunting for some temporary bonus items for example an extra feather that gets spawned in random location on the map possibly with a general area hint similar to those treasure notes the hint notes can have a few like 4 specific spawn locations and a note spawns at one of the preset locations at random so yeah some bonus daily spawns that add something peculiar even like a few different hats skins an extra feather different flight trail effects etc all of which last temporarily like a day in real time  also please the ability to reset the hunt manually it's quite fun to traverse the map just after i have found everything  it feels empty i would like to revisit the game but i've already explored it extensively so would be nice to be able to use that knowledge of the game for some fresh extra activities
游戏能否适配下apple silicon的mac还有支持中文,游戏能否适配下apple silicon的mac还有支持中文
ps4 controller inputs not recognized macbook m1,what more can i say just bought the game on store it says full controller support i boot it up in big picture and my bluetooth connected ps4 controllers inputs are not being recognized at all theyre not recognized in menu not detected in settings and not recognized in game either anyone have any ideas
beachstickball,i currently have 8 hours playtime and i swear about 4 of those has been trying to get to 30 in beachstickball i just can't get passed 25
sound while game is not focused,i wonder if anybody managed to have the sound of the game playing even when the game is not focused  i really want to work study with the music and atmosphere of the game but every time i focus another window like my mail client the sound of the game is muted
cannot play on steam deck,i have a regular steam deck with the latest updates when i launched the game it has press z to start no buttons did anything so i bought up the on screen keyboard and pressed z there which brought me to the next menu in this menu i could not use the touchscreen or the on screen keyboard to move to options  it is completely unplayable i could maybe make a custom control mapping for the inputs in steam but who knows what lies down that rabbit hole when i can't even find out what bindings there are without googling it  i understand that input detection is difficult but the correct answer is not to lock out inputs you should always listen for and respond to any input that the player might use  input detection should be used to prompts only and should automatically switch based on whatever the last type of input received was
will the steam version be identical to the humble original release,and if the steam release receives updates will the humble build be updated as well
golden feathers randomly disappearing,my kid's really been loving this game unfortunately for some reason when she's climbing a lot near hawks peak her golden feather total just vanishes not the normal freezing reheating thing like completely deleted from inventory only fix i can think of is a complete restart with a fresh new game any reason for this ways to avoid or get feathers back
similar game recommendations,really enjoyed this game other games i could recommend with a similar vibe and enjoyable mechanics would be toem grow home and its sequel grow up got any other recommendations
parkour race,i've finished all 3 races and gotten the medal but it didn't give me the race achievement i'm not sure what to do
removing the fog,is there any way to remove the fog this game is aesthetically gorgeous but the core concept of the game is nearly always ruined by the refusal to fully render anything that isn't within a relatively short distance considering i gathered my feathers reached the peak of the mountain and began my highflying victory lap of the world below only to be greeted by a field of tan this really defeats the purpose of the game i want the option to see further once you have more than 10 feathers and access to more places the game becomes an incomprehensible expanse of tan and to a directionally challenged player who is forced into the desired camera angle of the devs that means i have absolutely no idea where anything is ever no way to find out and no way to appreciate the island on a larger scale to get my bearings this really soured me on the game it's a comfy mostly polished gem but the clunky item system and this massive oversight make me hesitate to echo the praise it has been given
humble key still missing,good day it looks like the humble keys are still not up can i get a steam key somehow i would like to experience this game too
chances for more updates,i was really surpriased to find the newer achievements or the multiplayer mod for april sadly didn´t manage to test that out does anybody think the game will add even more stuff down the line even if it´s just small bits or do you prefer a new one dlc me personally for example would love to have separated save files so i could keep my 100 save and also start a new one  i´m all in for anything i love this game
translate game,i love this game so much i wish my cousin could have as much fun as i did but he has a hard time with english i'm willing to translate the text if needed not sure if its something that easy to implement in the game i would translate it to portuguese
transfer achievements from bundle pack,hi i bought the game while ago  and decided to play yesterday so today  i bought on steam but the game opened on the same point as the bundle that i bought  i finished the game but the achievement list didn't updated how can i update my achievement list on steam with the ones that i already got
bug got stuck between rock and wall,got stuck between a rock and the wall next to the beachstickball court screenshot    none of the controls really work the character is stuck in a falling state but i can't even glide out is there a cheat that will teleport me back to the start i'm not very far along but i'd like to not start over
this would be so cool if it had a multiplayer mode,relax with friend ahhhh
could someone offer me a completed save file,hello so i mainly play games for achievements nowadays to keep me moving on from one game to the next and not spend so much time just playing the same game over and over again looking at you endlessly moddable skyrim i finished this game's set of achievements back in february but now the game just pushed out four new ones since then i've switched over to linux and reinstalled windows fresh and today realized that my original completed game was lost to the reformat since it's tucked away in the appdata folder and i wasn't backing that up manually would anyone be able to provide me with a copy of a completed saved file i'm not specifically interested in spending the few hours to redo what i've already done once in this game  thanks
🐦 a short hike 99  a multiplayer mod 🐦,from the dev twitter this was supposed to be some sort of april fools joke but i don't wanna confuse anyone so i'm just gonna drop some facts facts👇 ⭐️ it's a rough mod 🚫 this won't be an official game mode sorry ➡️ test it here

rare fish,out of curiosity has anyone discovered any secret fish i caught every rare fish variant for each of the journal fish but neither npc seemed to care  there's probably nothing more and it's just for personal satisfaction but i wanted to ask if i was missing something  some wholly new special fish that can only be caught with the journal reward  slightly weird that there's zero reward for  actually  completing the journal
arrow keys,is there any way to move without arrow keys because i have a 60 keyboard and you also need arrow keys to get to the options button
ps4 controller on mac help,hello just got this game today and am having a lot of trouble getting my ps4 dual shock controller to work properly on my mac connected with a usb cable i can use the controller in the game if i do not select the ps controller option however the analog stick stops working at full extension so the only way to play is by only slightly moving the analog stick in the direction i want to go if i push it close to the max the game stops reading or wrongly reads the input and my character will either stop moving or go in a different direction if anyone knows how to solve this problem i would really appreciate it thanks

issues with general usb controller,hey so i just bought the game and i started having issues with getting input from my controller i've gotten it to register me pressing the a button once or twice but immediately after it doesn't register anything from it i have tried using the advanced controller configuration in the game and it doesn't really change anything it just isn't recognizing my controller the controller does work on other games i used it for celeste immediately after and had no issues it is being recognized by my computer as a controller  i don't know if it really matters but it is a gamecube controller connected through a usb adapter probably a really stupid and easy solution but i'd really like to play the game with a controller and this is my only controller thanks for any help update still having an issue but i have a better idea on why so anytime i start the game it takes the first input from my controller so i know it is recognizing my controller correctly but after that first input it stops recognizing my controller i opened the community tab while the game was running and then shut it and it recognized one input from my controller again and stopped recognizing again have not really any idea what to do from here i uninstalled and reinstalled the game i am on windows 10 i tried disabling the community tab no dice

multiplayer,is there going to be a multiplayer mode
is the pretentious warning when disabling the pixel filter really necessary,it's great that you included the option to disable the pixel filter but the giant warning when turning it off is ridiculous  it has zero impact on the gameplay or the narrative it's nothing more than an aesthetic choice  forcing people to click through an info box about how the game will be adversely affected by turning it off is not only insulting but it's not necessary  let your users make their choice without trying to guilt trip them over it
nintendo switch please,i would love to have this on my switch please consider a port i know nintendo is probably a pain in the butt but i know a lot of people would love to have this on switch

playable on 32bit linux,hi there  i downloaded this game to my ubuntu 1604 32bit machine and apparently there is only an executable for 64bit systems at least i can only find ashorthikex8664 steam is reporting an missing executable error as it is looking for ashorthikex86 can anyone confirm this would be a pity if the game does not work on 32bit systems thanks tobias
rental boat glitch,hello first of all thanks for such a great game i had the best time playing it the other evening i'm sorry but i can't provide a screenshot for this glitch but i had just parked the rental boat alongside the fisherman's boat and i flew up to talk to him when i was done i went back to the rental boat but i found it compenetrated hopefully this is the right term the fisherman's boat i think this happened because when you leave the rental boat it moves a little so it went partially inside the fisherman's boat i couldn't ride it anymore because just its tip was visible being swallowed for the most part then i started swimming frantically around it hoping it would get unstuck i manged to go inside the fisherman's boat myself and push it out from the inside it took some trial and error because i couldn't see the character anymore since it was hidden
where's the boat rental,i just can't find the bloody thing please help
bug report  got any fish switch version,i'm unable to make a post on bug reports on steam due to owning this game on switch and not steam after taking the boat off the ramp and consequentially breaking it the pelican will fix it for you after they fix it they'll ask if you've got any fish saying yes does not bring up the menu to show them fish as it should closing the game and rebooting it fixed this issue but i just wanted to bring it to your attention
this game is awesome,i just wanted to say this game was worth every penny so very fun if i had one thing against it it would be that the camera flips and then all of a sudden your going flying in a completely different direction than you intended too but that's a very minor issue so dang fun

i changed the time on my computer and it deleted my save,i wanted to get the achievement for strawberry toastwhich requires the time to be 5pm so i changed the time to try and get it but when i got to the main menu there was no continue option and all the save slots were empty is there any way to get my save back or am i screwed
mouse and keyboard,can you play a short hike also with mouse and keyboard   because i don't have a controller
so too hard for a 5 year old,her mouse precision and keyboard dexterity is poor at best i wouldn't coop with her in a platformer delightful kid but you don't want her on you pubg clan if you know what i mean would this game be good for her  something like rime if you know it is too hard for her
mouse only controls,can this game be played and enjoyed with just a 2button mouse my disability limits me to play with only a 2button mouse
can you fish without bait,i managed to lose the two worms i had during my first very inept attempt at fishing since then i've been trying to fish without bait because most online guides say it's possible just takes a bit longer however i've been at it for an extremely long time now at least 50 attempts at meteor lake without a single catch i'm wondering if i'm doing something wrong  do i need to do something more than just pressing x to reel in my line when the thingy gets pulled under to indicate that a fish is biting i've had a few instances of a fish seemingly pulling at the line while i was trying to reel it in but this invariably ends with my line breaking or the fish escaping or whatever i'm not sure how to interpret the animation there no caught fish anyway

feature suggestion visual cue for start of racing minigame for deaf players,hi developers of this game i just bought your game and got to the summit and it was wonderful on the summit i loved the people i met on my way there and i love the backstory of the main character and her family so i just really want to thank you for making this game and for the composer for making such wonderful music now on to my feature request in the racing minigame there are 3 beeps that count down to the start of the race i noticed there are no visual indicators that the race is about to start could there be some kind of symbol or visual cue that the race is starting i'm hard of hearing but still have enough hearing left to hear those beeps and the music but deaf people will hear nothing and will not know that the race is starting thanks goliathfan

is this game particularly easy,specifically in where to go how to get there etc i'm wanting to get this for my sister who has only really ever played the sims follow up can you click to move the character or does it require arrow keys should i get her a controller does it use the right stick for the camera i've noticed that last bit is an especially large barrier for people who haven't used controllers
final hidden achievement however i dont know what it is,i only have 1 more achievement to get however it is hidden and im not completely sure what it is  im wondering if all of these sticks i've been gathering have something to do with it  or the shell necklace the extra shells  any help would be appreciated   thanks d ps  also maybe something to do with the pickaxes i still have 6 of them  could be the stone circles too there a a few of those  maybe even flying around for a certain amount of time idk just guessing here  catch some rare fish with the golden rod  it could be several things
stolen ac art,that fish shadow and the cracks that you dig look 100 straight ripped out of an animal crossing game not even inspired but actually ripped right
silver feathers,so i got everything in this game and have been everywhere however i got only 2 silver feathers now i ask myself if there isn't a third one since this game likes to have 1 or 3 things of everything anyone got a clue to where it could be or if there even is one extra mountain island and goat quest are done
hiking dog who wants to uproot life to go on daily hikes consequences,there's a whitefurred dog who loves a particular hiking route very much and wishes to go on daily hikes there the dog asks you if you think it should uproot its life and move home to do this i said no hoping i would then get to choose the other option however even after quitting and reloading my game unfortunately the dog wouldn't ask me again i'm now  super curious  what would have happened if i had chosen the other option i feel incredibly responsible for this dog's future does anyone know does it make a difference whenever i talk to the dog now it just says well i gotta get my hike on catch ya later
will there be content updates,i absolutely loved this game got all the achievements too wish we could see more of this game or maybe steam profile icons that would be nice too

how can i get through this tunnel,
chest under sandcastle,on the beach next to aunt may’s cabin if you dig up the sandcastle you hit something metallic but it won’t come up any clues
when i can buy dlc and lootboxes with hats,do developers working on some additional payment gameplay for this game when they will add lootboxes there when batle royal mode do they working on craft and building constractor systems
what's the name of this art style,i like the name of this art style it's definitely retro but not just 2d it fits in with older 3d nintendo ds games like animal crossing or phantom hourglass but with those examples this art style simply comes from the limitations of that specific time period whereas here it's on purpose so what's the name of this blend of retro 3d visuals
northern pike bill,i'm missing exactly one fish but i don't know where to get it to make matters worse i did get the albino version of it but not the normal one who is bill edit i ended up finding it it's in meteor lake where you learn how to fish

feature request thread,could we have a text autoadvance option please pressing x twentynine times talking to each character is really tedious i don't think it would ruin the pacing of the conversations either it would be nice
celeste similarities,does this game remind anyone of celeste a girl trying to get to the top of a mountain golden feathers no just me
featherless tips,sooooooooo i've reached the summit entirely featherless via the most  state of the art techniques  such as smashing myself against a ledge until i got over it brute forcing an entire climbing wall by literally just spamming jump and pushing against it however i've reached the last literal wall which i don't want to try and brute force after the last climbing wall  iimgurcom is there some sort of thing that will just boost me up the last tiny bit my fingers are tired from mashing jump and the arrow keys
ultrawide 219,would that be complicated to implement ultrawidescreen resolutions such as 2560x1080 and 3440x1440 the game looks so gorgeous
hawk peak with no feathers,hi i've been trying to reach the top without collecting any feathers progress has halted at the base of the peak to anyone who's reached the top with no feathers could you please share how you got past the last slope without climbing
macos nvidia  workaround for freezes,it seems a few macos users with nvidia graphics cards had an issue where the screen would freeze but you could still hear the game running in the background you can still hear running and jumping sounds until there's a proper fix you can use this method to fix the issue   right click on a short hike in your steam library and click properties   click set launch options   type in forceopengl sorry for any trouble this has caused to the affected users
flickering shadows,i'm getting a weird issue where the shadows flicker the easy to fix is to just turn the shadows off but this is obviously not ideal is this a known issue intel core i54300 haswell at 32ghz 8gb ddr3 ram intel hd 4600 manjaro linux 64bit to emphasise i am using the linux version thanks
hawks peak with six feathers,anybody else get there with six
bug   infinite golden feathers glitch,hello  i discovered something that looks like a glitch by chance i left the game standing on an emplacement of golden feather and when i restarted it to play it says you found a golden feather i redid to be sure and yep i got another golden feather maybe it's the only location that actually works i was standing on the golden feather at the right of the place where i found the water bucket i don't know if it's really a glitch or a bug or maybe an easy way to get golden feathers but maybe it isn't intentional so if it can help
achievement issue,i need some help with the crispy achievement i did everything you need too get it and i still don't have it can anybody help
fun game but,is there any way to remove the pixelation filter i get that the specific look of the game is that of an old fashioned 16bit game but i can tell it's a filter and it really gets in the way of enjoying the game switching it off would really help
typo,this one of my favourite spots rather than this  is  one of my favourite spots love everything you've done with the game keep up the good work
